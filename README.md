in this project I practiced redux and jwt knowledge. Project wasn't hard at all. The biggest enemy was css of course :D

Here is the picture of redux structure:

In main page i fetching all products by dispatching redux actions and giving object filters to apply. ( productActions.js, Filters.js)

After clicking, I set the page of a single product based on the redirection from the link (useParams)

You can add products to the cart. There is an alert while adding.

You can also add review to product (if you are logged :D)

There is also a profile site where you can change ship adress and see your orders. (not the prettiest)
